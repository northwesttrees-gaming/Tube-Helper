# YouTube Thumbnail Helper
I was looking for a tool that could easily scale the image based on YouTube's thumbnail sizes across their site. I quickly found out that sites were charging for this very simple thing that someone with very little know-how with HTML or simply Google could do for free. So I made this quick and easy HTML page that can scale the "myThumbnail.jpg" file across all thumbnail sizes. There is also alternate thumbnails which can be replaced using Notepad++ replace tool using the video IDs.  
  
Feel free to use this tool how you like, it's open source because something like this should not be charged for IMO.

# How To Use
1. Download the files from the resources tab.
2. Open the HTML file with your browser.
    1. Can work online or offline as long as you have a browser.
3. Replace the myThumbnail.jpg with your custom thumbnail.
    1. Make sure that the name and extension (.jpg) are the same.
4. Refresure the page in your browser
    1. This will update the myThumbnail.jpg image in the HTML document.
