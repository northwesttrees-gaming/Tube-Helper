# YouTube Thumbnail Helper
I was looking for a tool that could easily scale the image based on YouTube's thumbnail sizes across their site. I quickly found out that sites were charging for this very simple thing that someone with very little know-how with HTML or simply Google could do for free. So I made this quick and easy HTML page that can scale the "myThumbnail.jpg" file across all thumbnail sizes. There is also alternate thumbnails which can be replaced using Notepad++ replace tool using the video IDs.  
  
Feel free to use this tool how you like, it's open source because something like this should not be charged for IMO.
